We are reusing code from the previous topic, but in this case we import the label module that contains the Label class.

This class is responsible for rendering the text, in the return of the build () function is the construction of a Label object, between the parentheses are the properties defined in it. Such as the text and the font size (note the difference that "" is used in the text)

What we get on the screen when we execute the code is a Label widget that occupies the entire window, and we don't find anything other than the text that we put in its properties.
